# Impacts of Extreme Heat on NYC Subway Ridership
## This study utilizes two primary datasets to analyze the impact of heat waves on subway ridership in New York City: historical weather data and MTA Origin-Destination (O/D) trip data. Open Meteo provided hourly and daily weather records, including temperature, apparent temperature, precipitation, and cloud cover. The O/D dataset, obtained through an API, contains trip-level information where each row represents a single subway trip, including the origin station, destination station, timestamp, and other relevant attributes. Supplemental datasets included Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) scores from the NYC Department of Health, and American Community Survey data on median household income.
